title: Notes from Stanford CS144 Course
categories: [Software]

I've decided to start dedicating each month of the year to learning/polishing a core CS area, there's always something new to learn out there. For me particularly, there's a lot! I whiled away my time during my undergrad for the most part, so hopefully this fixes my foundation. For areas where I'm quite confident (Algorithms), I'll try and take on tougher challenges

For April, I've selected Computer Networks, this is partly motivated by my work at ELB team at AWS, and the course that I'll be doing is Stanford CS144.
