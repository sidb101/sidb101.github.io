#### [419. Battleships in a Board](https://leetcode.com/problems/battleships-in-a-board/description/)

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` where each cell is a battleship `'X'` or empty `'.'`, return the number of the **battleships**  on `board`.

**Battleships**  can only be placed horizontally or vertically on `board`. In other words, they can only be made of the shape `1 x k` (`1` row, `k` columns) or `k x 1` (`k` rows, `1` column), where `k` can be of any size. At least one horizontal or vertical cell separates between two battleships (i.e., there are no adjacent battleships).

**Example 1:** 

<img alt="" src="https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/10/battelship-grid.jpg" style="width: 133px; height: 133px;">

```
Input: board = [["X",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"],[".",".",".","X"]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:** 

```
Input: board = [["."]]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:** 

- `m == board.length`
- `n == board[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `board[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'X'`.

**Solution:** 

We could simply count the top-left corners of a battleship, and since there
are no colliding battleships, these points uniquely identify a battleship

```python
class Solution:
    def countBattleships(self, board: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        m, n = len(board), len(board[0])
        ans = 0
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if board[i][j] == '.':
                    continue
                if i > 0 and board[i-1][j] == 'X':
                    continue
                if j > 0 and board[i][j-1] == 'X':
                    continue
                ans += 1
        return ans
```
